# Deadrare ranking

## How to use the project ? 

1. De-zip the file
2. Go on Google Chrome 
3. Open Parameters > More Tools > Extensions
4. Select the "Load no packed extension" button and choose the "Extension" folder to open
5. Just go on Deadrare website to see the ranks of your favorite collection

## Actual problems
- Sometimes the rank won't load at the first connexion, just refresh deadrare. 
- The collection is set by hand in script.js file
- The datasets are limited to those collections : DRIFTERS, ElrondApes, High Stree tWolf S., LightningBolt, Maiarpunks, The FacelessMany, MonkeySupremacy, The Ducks, Spacerobot, Validators, WWWINE, Emidas, Gnogons.

## Be careful
The ranking is based on the one from Elrond Index, it may not be the official rank. Before buying any NFT don't hesitate to check on time the rank on ElrondIndex to be sure. 

## TODO :
- Add more collections
- Perform an automatic update of collection rankings
- Wait for google validation for a true extension
- Add ranks in my collection
- Get the First top "2000" on an interface if we ask for rank 2000 --> price and number
- Create a github
- Add a way to personalize thresholds and their colors
- Add a way to load a new collection from elrond index by its name
